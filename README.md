# Scrimba Solo Project - Color Scheme Generator

## About
[Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) Solo Project
built from a Figma design using the [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/).  Using a "seed" color with `<input type="color"/>`, then selecting a color scheme mode with a `<select>` box will generate the
color scheme with hex values.

Bonus: when clicking the hex values will copy them to the 
clipboard.
